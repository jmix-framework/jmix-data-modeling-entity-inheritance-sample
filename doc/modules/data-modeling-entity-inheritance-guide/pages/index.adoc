= Data Modeling: Entity Inheritance

Entity inheritance is a key approach for structuring domain models with shared attributes and specialized behavior. In the Pet Clinic application, for example, pets share common fields like name and birthdate, but specific types such as cats or birds have unique properties. Similarly, visits to the clinic can vary in type, requiring distinct data fields.

This guide explores JPA inheritance strategies and demonstrates their application in a Jmix project. Practical examples from the Pet Clinic domain model will illustrate how to choose the right strategy for different scenarios.

[[what-we-are-going-to-build]]
== What We are Going to Build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/Jmix-framework/Jmix-petclinic-2[Jmix Petclinic^] example by implementing various JPA inheritance strategies:

* **Mapped Superclass (NamedEntity):** We will look into the base class `NamedEntity` that centralizes common fields like `id`, `name`, and auditing attributes. Entities such as `Owner`, `PetType`, and `Specialty` inherit these fields.

* **Joined Table Inheritance (Pet Hierarchy):** The `Pet` base class includes subclasses like `Cat` and `Bird`. Subclass-specific attributes are stored in their own tables, while polymorphic queries allow listing all pets.

* **Single Table Inheritance (Visit Hierarchy):** The `Visit` base class encompasses subclasses like `RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUp`. All visits are stored in a single table, enabling efficient polymorphic queries and simplifying associations.

These scenarios highlight the strengths and trade-offs of each inheritance strategy within the Petclinic domain.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Business applications often deal with complex domains that require clear and maintainable representations of shared and specialized data. Entity inheritance allows us to model things that are very similar, but a different. It provides a way to define common attributes and behavior in a base class while letting subclasses add their own specifics. This not only avoids redundancy but also aligns closely with how you as a develoepr think about your domain.

In the Petclinic application, we could use entity inheritance to structure the domain model based on real use-cases like:

* **Pets:** All pets share attributes such as `name` and `birthDate`, but specific types, such as cats and birds, introduce unique fields like `litterBoxTrained` or `wingspan`. Inheritance allows these specialized attributes to coexist with common ones, enabling operations like listing all pets or filtering by type.
* **Visits:** Different types of visits, such as `RegularCheckup` or `EmergencyVisit`, require additional fields specific to their type. At the same time, all visits share common properties like `visitStart` and `treatmentStatus`, which can be handled in the base class.

[[impedance-mismatch]]
=== Impedance Mismatch

Object-oriented programming languages like Java naturally support inheritance, allowing you to create hierarchies with shared attributes and specialized behavior. Polymorphism and method overriding make these hierarchies intuitive to design and maintain. In contrast, relational databases are built around flat, tabular structures, where data is stored in rows and columns without inherent support for hierarchical relationships. This fundamental difference is known as the "impedance mismatch" between object models and relational databases.

To resolve this mismatch, mapping frameworks like JPA use a combination of techniques to bridge the gap. One common approach is to utilize multiple tables to represent an inheritance hierarchy. For example, a base entity might be stored in a separate table, while subclasses have their own tables containing specific attributes. When retrieving data, an SQL `SELECT` statement is used to join these tables, combining the base and subclass data into a single result set that can be mapped back to the object model. Additionally, metadata such as a discriminator column is often stored in the database. This metadata indicates the specific type of each entity, ensuring that data is accurately converted back into the correct Java object when loaded.

JPA provides several strategies to handle these inheritance mappings. These strategies allow you to balance trade-offs between query performance, data integrity, and schema complexity.

[[polymorphic-queries]]
==== Polymorphic Queries

One solution of JPA to the impedance mismatch of inheritance is polymorphic queries. Let's look at what this is, as it is relevant later in this guide quite a bit.

Polymorphic queries is a JPQL feature, that allows you to query a base class and transparently retrieve instances of all its subclasses. For example, a query on the `Visit` base class like `SELECT e from petclinic_Visit e` can fetch both `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit` entities without needing separate queries for each subclass.

This feature simplifies working with inheritance hierarchies. The "heavy lifting" on how this needs to be expressed on the database level is hidden by JPA. Depending on the chosen inheritance strategy, the underlying SQL query generated by JPQL differs, as the data may be spread across one or more tables in the database.

In this guide, we will explore how these strategies can be applied within the Petclinic domain to address real-world modeling challenges. Starting with Single Table Inheritance, we will work through examples that illustrate the strengths and appropriate use cases for each strategy.

[[mapped-superclass]]
== Mapped Superclass

The `@MappedSuperclass` is the first option to define shared attributes and behavior in a base class without creating a corresponding database table for the superclass. This approach is ideal for scenarios where entities share common fields, but there is no need for polymorphic querying or explicit relationships between those entities in the database. Strictly speaking it does not an official "inheritance strategy" (we will see later why), but still of it is quite often used to introduce a hierarchy in the Java domain model.

[[mapped-superclass-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

In the Petclinic application, the `NamedEntity` class illustrates this concept. It defines common system attributes such as `id`, `version`, auditing fields (`createdBy`, `createdDate`, etc.), and a `name` field, which is annotated with `@InstanceName`. This enables the `name` field to serve as the default display name for the entity in the Jmix UI. Subclasses of `NamedEntity` inherit these attributes, which keeps your entities source code cleaner.

.NamedEntity.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/NamedEntity.java[tags=start-class;end-class]
----

The `NamedEntity` superclass is inherited by several entities, including `Pet`, `PetType`, and `Specialty`. As you can see in the source code, the `NamedEntity` does not have an `@Table` annotation. This means there is no corresponding table for the `NamedEntity` itself in the database. Instead, only its subclasses, such as `Pet` and `PetType`, define their own database tables.

.PetType.java
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/PetType.java[]
----

Each subclass has its own dedicated database table, and the shared fields from `NamedEntity` are incorporated into these tables. Here is an image of the resulting entity-relationship diagram:

image::mapped-superclass.svg[]

[[mapped-superclass-dataaccess]]
=== Data Access

Because `NamedEntity` does not have a corresponding table in the database, it cannot be queried directly or by using a polymorphic query. For instance, the following query is **not valid**:

.Invalid query (not supported for `@MappedSuperclass`)
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
SELECT n
FROM petclinic_NamedEntity n
WHERE n.name = :name
----

Instead, queries have to be performed on the specific subclasses. For example:

.Query by the `name` field in `Specialty`
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
SELECT s
FROM petclinic_Specialty s
WHERE s.name = :name
----

These queries operate on the subclass tables but utilize the shared fields defined in `NamedEntity`. Since the attributes are inherited, they are treated as if they are native to the subclasses in both JPQL queries and in the resulting SQL.

[[single-table-inheritance]]
== Single Table Inheritance

Single Table Inheritance is a strategy where all entities in an inheritance hierarchy are stored in a single database table. When a subclass has a new attribute, it is added as an additional column in the table. This way, the table holds a superset of the attributes of all subclasses as well as the attributes of the superclass itself.

But how does JPA determine which subclass a row in the table belongs to? The answer lies in the discriminator column. This is a special column that enables JPA to correctly map database rows back to their corresponding Java objects by storing a value that identifies the specific subclass. When JPA reads a row from the `VISIT` table, it inspects the value in the `DTYPE` column to determine the appropriate subclass. Based on this value, JPA instantiates the correct Java object (e.g., `RegularCheckup` or `EmergencyVisit`) and populates its attributes with the corresponding column values from the row.

This approach offers simplicity in querying and efficient read operations, as all data resides in one table. However, it comes with the trade-off of potentially large tables with many nullable columns for subclass-specific fields.

[WARNING]
====
**Required Fields on Subclasses**

One important limitation of Single Table Inheritance is that it does not allow defining `NOT NULL` constraints for fields specific to subclasses. Since all entities in the hierarchy share the same table, subclass-specific fields must remain nullable to accommodate rows representing other entity types.

This limitation means that enforcing data integrity on subclass-specific fields at the database level is not possible. However, you can still ensure data integrity at the application level using Bean Validation in Jmix. You can use `@NotNull` on fields in the domain model to validate data before it is persisted to the database.
====

Let's look at our example use-case for Single Table Inheritance: modeling visits. Visits can have different types like `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit`. Common attributes are stored in the base class, while subclass-specific attributes are nullable fields in the same table.

[[single-table-inheritance-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

Let's look at the JPA entity definition in more detail. The base class contains attributes shared by all entities, while subclass-specific attributes are added as additional columns. Below is the `Visit` base class and its two subclasses, `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit`.

.Visit.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/Visit.java[tags=imports;start-class;end-class]
----
<1> The existence of the `@Table` annotation indicates that the Visit entity has a dedicated table (compared to `NamedEntity`). It defines the database table `PETCLINIC_VISIT`.
<2> The `@Inheritance` annotation configures the `SINGLE_TABLE` strategy, where all entities in the hierarchy are stored in a single table. Subclass attributes are added as additional columns and thus don't need to configure a `@Table` annotation on their own.
<3> The `@DiscriminatorColumn` annotation establishes the `DTYPE` column, which stores the type of each subclass. This ensures that JPA can map database rows to the correct Java objects based on their type.


.RegularCheckup.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/RegularCheckup.java[]
----

.EmergencyVisit.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/EmergencyVisit.java[]
----

The subclasses mainly `extend Visit` indicating that it inherits all attributes and is stored in the `VISIT` table as indicated by the Visit entity. Additionally, the subclasses define the value of the discriminator column for this specific subclass via the `@DiscriminatorValue` annotation: `REGULAR_CHECKUP` or `EMERGENCY_VISIT`.


[[single-table-inheritance-databaseschema]]
=== Database Schema

Let's look at the resulting entity-relationship diagram of the database:

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::single-table-inheritance.svg[alt="Entity Relationship Diagram for Single Table Inheritance", title="Single Table Inheritance ER Diagram", link="_images/single-table-inheritance.svg"]

The `Visit` table consolidates all entities in the inheritance hierarchy. Common fields like `id`, `pet_id`, and `visit_start` are shared across all visit types. The `dtype` column identifies the specific subclass, while subclass-specific attributes like `emergency_type` and `next_appointment_date` are simply stored as additional columns in the same table.

[[single-table-inheritance-ui]]
=== UI Representation

Now, let’s look into how Single Table Inheritance works in the user interface. With Jmix, we can create standard views to handle entities and their subclasses. In this section, we will explore how different visit types (`RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUpVisit`) can be managed, from creating new visits to displaying them in polymorphic lists.

==== Determining the Visit Type Detail View

To create a new visit, we implemented a dialog specifically for this example, allowing users to select the appropriate subclass. The dialog presents options for visit types such as `RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUpVisit`. Once a type is selected, the corresponding detail view for the chosen subclass is opened, displaying fields relevant to that type.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::input-dialog-new-visit.png[alt="Type Selection Dialog for Visits", title="Type Selection Dialog for Visits", link="_images/input-dialog-new-visit.png"]

Here is how this is implemented in the controller when creating a new visit:

.VisitListView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/VisitListView.java[tags=start-class;type-selection;end-class]
----
<1> The `visitTypes` map is created and passed set as the items for the select component.
<2> After the user confirms their selection, the selected visit type class is retrieved from the dialog's result via `closeEvent.getValue("type")`.
<3> The `viewNavigators.detailView` method navigates to the detail view for the selected visit type, creating a new instance of the entity and showing its specific fields.

Using the type selection dialog, the application dynamically determines the appropriate subclass for the new `Visit` entity. After the user confirms their selection, Jmix navigates to the corresponding detail view for the chosen subclass. This is because we pass in the correct type into the `detailView` method of the `ViewNavigators` bean. The detail views are simply standard Jmix detail views for each subclass.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::regular-checkup-detail.png[alt="Regular Checkup Detail View with Relevant Fields", title="Regular Checkup Detail View", link="_images/regular-checkup-detail.png"]

The `RegularCheckup` detail view includes the `Next Appointment Date` field, specific to this visit type. Common fields like `Description` and `Visit Start`, inherited from the `Visit` entity, are also displayed. When we look at the `EmergencyVisit` detail view, you can see the emergency-specific fields such as `Emergency Type` and a checkbox for `Life Threatening`:

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::emergency-visit-detail.png[alt="Emergency Visit Detail View with Emergency-Specific Fields", title="Emergency Visit Detail View", link="_images/emergency-visit-detail.png"]


==== Polymorphic Query in Visit List View

Let's focus on how we display visits of all subtypes. As we learned before, all types of visits (`RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, `FollowUpVisit`) are stored in a single table. In the view descriptor, we load the data as we would for any regular JPA entity. Below is an excerpt of the XML configuration for the `VisitListView`:

.visit-list-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/visit-list-view.xml[tags=visit-list-loader]
----
<1> The `collection` element defines a `CollectionContainer` for the base class `Visit`. This container serves as the binding point for the data grid in the UI and holds all visit entities, regardless of their specific subclass.
<2> The `loader` element specifies a `CollectionDataLoader` that uses the JPQL query `SELECT e FROM petclinic_Visit e`. This query fetches all rows from the `Visit` table, leveraging the discriminator column (`dtype`) to ensure JPA loads the correct subclass for each entity.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::visit-list-view.png[alt="Visit List View", title="Visit List View", link="_images/visit-list-view.png"]

When the query is executed, JPQL fetches all data from the `Visit` table and relies on the discriminator column to map each row to its correct subclass. While the table displays only common columns shared across all visit types, the data loader transparently handles the polymorphic behavior, ensuring that each record is represented as its appropriate Java object.

When we enable SQL logging, we can observe the SQL query executed by JPA. Below is the formatted SQL query that corresponds to what is executed:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
SELECT LIMIT 0 50
    visit.ID,
    visit.DTYPE,
    visit.CREATED_BY,
    visit.CREATED_DATE,
    visit.DELETED_BY,
    visit.DELETED_DATE,
    visit.DESCRIPTION,
    visit.LAST_MODIFIED_BY,
    visit.LAST_MODIFIED_DATE,
    visit.TREATMENT_STATUS,
    visit.TYPE_,
    visit.VERSION,
    visit.VISIT_END,
    visit.VISIT_START,
    visit.ASSIGNED_NURSE_ID,
    visit.PET_ID
FROM
    PETCLINIC_VISIT visit
WHERE
    visit.DELETED_DATE IS NULL
ORDER BY
    visit.VISIT_START DESC,
    visit.ID ASC
----

[[visualize-entity-type-in-ui]]
==== Visualize Entity Type in UI

When integrating entity hierarchies into the UI, the challenge arises of how to display and work with entity types. At first glance, you might consider leveraging the discriminator column (`DType`) used in the database. However, this column is not a true entity attribute. It lacks getters and setters, cannot be localized or translated, and is generally not intended for direct use in application logic. Additionally, it cannot be used in Jmix UI components such as the Generic Filter for searching, sorting, or filtering.

To address this limitation, we introduce a dedicated `type` field alongside the `DType` column. Represented as an regular Jmix `Enum`, this `type` field is mainly used for the UI and application code. It supports localization, enables filtering and sorting in polymorphic views, and provides a more developer-friendly interface for working with entity types.

To ensure that the `type` field reflects the correct subclass, we assign its value using a `@PostConstruct` lifecycle callback in each subclass. For instance, the `RegularCheckup` class assigns the `type` field as follows:

.RegularCheckup.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/RegularCheckup.java[tags=start-class;init-visit-type;end-class]
----

With this in place for each subclass, we can use the `type` field is as a column as well as for filtering:

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::visit-list-view-type-filter.png[alt="Visit List View with Type Filter", title="Visit List View with Type Filter", link="_images/visit-list-view-type-filter.png"]

This wraps up our first entity inheritance approach: Single Table Inheritance. As we have seen, it provides a straightforward way to manage entity hierarchies in a single table. It allows polymorphic queries and avoids the need for multiple joins. However, there are limitations to this approach, particularly when subclass-specific fields have required fields, as we discussed earlier.

To overcome this limitation, we can use the Joined inheritance strategy, which we will cover in the next section.

[[joined-inheritance]]
== Joined Table Inheritance

Joined Table Inheritance maps an inheritance hierarchy into multiple tables. The base class has its own table, while each subclass has a separate table containing only fields specific to that subclass. Foreign keys connect the subclass tables to the base class table. This creates a more normalised database structure, as compared to Single Table Inheritance we don't end up with a lot of null values in columns. It is also more flexible, making it suitable for scenarios where subclass-specific fields need database-level constraints, such as `NOT NULL`, or separate indexing.

For this guide, we picked the `Pet` entity as an example for the joined table inheritance. Let's see at how the data model looks like.

[[joined-inheritance-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

The `Pet` class represents the base entity with shared attributes like `identificationNumber` and `birthdate`, while the subclasses `Bird` and `Cat` define specific fields.

Joined Table Inheritance uses the `@DiscriminatorColumn` exacly how we have seen it before in the case of Single Table inheritance. The `@DiscriminatorValue` annotation in each subclass specifies the value used in the discriminator column to identify rows belonging to that entity type. Additionally, the subclasses have a `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotation that is required by JPA for performing the join operation.

.Pet.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/Pet.java[tags=start-class;end-class]
----
The `Pet` class contains attributes such as `identificationNumber`, `birthdate`, and associations with the `Owner` and `PetType` entities.

.Bird.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/Bird.java[tags=class]
----
The `Bird` class adds the `wingspan` field, which is specific to birds.

.Cat.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/Cat.java[tags=class]
----
The `Cat` class includes fields like `clawLength` and `litterBoxTrained`, capturing attributes unique to cats.

[[joined-table-inheritance-databaseschema]]
=== Database Schema

In Joined Table Inheritance, the entity hierarchy is split into separate tables for the base class and each subclass. These tables are connected via a foreign key, enabling efficient joins when querying for subclass-specific data.

For the `Pet` hierarchy, the following tables are created:

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::joined-table-inheritance.svg[alt="Joined Table Inheritance Data Model", title="Joined Table Inheritance Data Model", link="_images/joined-table-inheritance.svg"]

[[joined-table-inheritance-dataaccess]]
=== Data Access

When querying the base class (`Pet`), a Join is performed between the base table (`PETCLINIC_PET`) and all appropriate subclass tables (`PETCLINIC_BIRD`, `PETCLINIC_CAT`).

For example, if querying all pets via the Jmix DataManager API, the resulting SQL looks like this:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
SELECT
    p.ID,
    p.IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER,
    p.BIRTHDATE,
    p.DTYPE,
    p.NAME,
    b.WINGSPAN,
    c.CLAW_LENGTH,
    c.LITTER_BOX_TRAINED
FROM PETCLINIC_PET p
LEFT JOIN PETCLINIC_BIRD b ON p.ID = b.ID
LEFT JOIN PETCLINIC_CAT c ON p.ID = c.ID;
----

The `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotation we already mentioned above establishes the relationship between the subclass tables and the base class table. This setup uses the primary key of the base class (`ID`) as the foreign key in the subclass tables. When executing queries involving joined inheritance, `LEFT JOIN` operations are performed between the base class table (`PETCLINIC_PET`) and each of the subclass tables (`PETCLINIC_BIRD`, `PETCLINIC_CAT`), ensuring all necessary data is combined for accurate representation of the inheritance hierarchy. The use of `LEFT JOIN` is necessary because a record in the base class table (`PETCLINIC_PET`) corresponds to data in at most one of the subclass tables (`PETCLINIC_BIRD`, `PETCLINIC_CAT`) or none at all. This means that for a given base class record, there will typically be no data in the other subclass tables. A `LEFT JOIN` ensures that the query result includes the base class record even when no matching data is found in the subclass tables, preserving the integrity of the polymorphic query.

For example, the following result set might be produced by a query fetching all `Pet` entities:

.Result Set Example for Joined Inheritance
[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| ID                                  | NAME        | IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER | DTYPE  | WINGSPAN | LITTER_BOX_TRAINED

| 1 | Rowlet      | 722                   | petclinic_Bird   | 0.30     | null
| 2 | Zubat       | 041                   | petclinic_Bird   | 0.75     | null
| 3 | Crobat      | 169                   | petclinic_Bird   | 1.50     | null
| 4 | Houndour    | 228                   | petclinic_Cat    | null     | false
| 5 | Rattata     | 019                   | petclinic_Cat    | null     | true
| 6 | Meowth      | 052                   | petclinic_Cat    | null     | true
|===

- The `DTYPE` column indicates the subclass (`petclinic_Bird` or `petclinic_Cat`).
- Fields like `WINGSPAN` and `LITTER_BOX_TRAINED` are only populated for rows that belong to their respective subclasses.
- Null values in subclass-specific fields reflect that the corresponding record does not belong to that subclass.

[[joined-table-inheritance-ui]]
=== UI Representation

Now let’s look at how the `Pet` hierarchy is displayed in the Petclinic application. One of the key use cases is presenting pets in a list view, such as showing all pets for a specific owner. This list provides a unified view of all pets, regardless of their specific type (`Bird`, `Cat`, etc.).

The data grid contains, shared fields like `Name`, `Identification Number`, and `Birthdate` are displayed.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::owner-pets-list.png[alt="List of Pets for an Owner", title="List of Pets for an Owner", link="_images/owner-pets-list.png"]

==== Dropdown for Creating Pets

Similar to the Visit example we need to determine which exact subclass should be used, when we create a Pet. This time we use a Dropdown Button for creating new pets in both the `Owner Detail View` and the `Pet List View`. Let's take a look how the button is implemented in the `Pet List View`.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::pet-list-view-create-dropdown.png[alt="Pet List View with Dropdown Button", title="Pet List View with Dropdown Button", link="_images/pet-list-view-create-dropdown.png"]

Below is the relevant portion of the `pet-list-view.xml`, where the `dropdownButton` and its actions are defined:

.pet-list-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/pet/pet/pet-list-view.xml[tags=pet-create-dropdown]
----
The `dropdownButton` contains multiple `actionItem` elements, each linked to a specific pet type creation action. The actions are defined on the `dataGrid` and have custom implementations in the controller. Each action dynamically determines the correct detail view to open based on the selected pet type. Here is the relevant Java code from the Controller:

.PetListView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/pet/pet/PetListView.java[tags=pet-create-actions]
----

By specifying the `viewClass` in the `ViewNavigators` call, we give Jmix the information which concrete subclass of Pet that is supposed to be instantiated.

==== Subclass-Specific Detail View

The screenshot above shows the detail view of a `Bird` entity. Similar to what we saw with Single Table Inheritance, this view displays both the attributes inherited from the base class (`Pet`) and subclass-specific fields.

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
image::bird-detail-view.png[alt="Bird Detail View", title="Bird Detail View", link="_images/bird-detail-view.png"]

One difference is that we are now able to create `NOT NULL` subclass fields. The `wingspan` field is marked as required, as indicated by the `@NotNull` constraint on the `Bird` entity class.

[[table-per-class-inheritance]]
== Table-Per-Class Inheritance

Table-Per-Class Inheritance maps each subclass to its own database table without using a shared base table. Each table contains the attributes specific to the subclass, including those inherited from the base class. This strategy can be appealing when queries are predominantly executed on specific subclasses, as it avoids the need for joins between a base table and subclass tables, simplifying queries and potentially improving performance for such cases.

However, the trade-offs of this approach are significant. Queries that span multiple subclasses (polymorphic queries) require `UNION` operations across the subclass tables. These operations are computationally expensive and can lead to poor performance, especially with large datasets.

[WARNING]
====
**Limited EclipseLink Support**

In Jmix, which uses EclipseLink as the JPA implementation, Table-Per-Class Inheritance faces additional limitations. Features like pagination, sorting, and filtering often do not work reliably with polymorphic queries under this strategy. These restrictions make it unsuitable for scenarios where polymorphic behavior or dynamic data retrieval is required.

====

In most cases, it is better to use other inheritance strategies:

- Use `@MappedSuperclass` if polymorphic behavior is unnecessary, and queries always target specific subclasses. This approach keeps the schema simple and avoids database-level inheritance.
- Use `Joined Table Inheritance` when polymorphic queries are needed and the downside of additional joins is acceptable.
- Use `Single Table Inheritance` for maximum query performance, as all entities are stored in a single table, though it limits database constraints for subclass-specific fields.

[[multilevel-inheritance]]
== Multilevel Inheritance

Although we only looked at one level-hierarchies, it’s worth mentioning that JPA also support multilevel inheritance. This means you can create deeper hierarchies with multiple levels of subclasses, such as having a `Bird` subclass of `Pet`, and further specialized subclasses like `Parrot` or `Owl`. Each level of the hierarchy can define its own fields and behaviors, and JPA will handle the mapping and querying appropriately based on the selected inheritance strategy.

Multilevel inheritance can be useful for highly detailed domain models where entities need to represent increasingly specific types. However, it’s important to carefully evaluate whether the added complexity aligns with the application’s requirements, as deeper hierarchies can lead to more complex queries and maintenance challenges.

It is important to note that within a single inheritance hierarchy, you cannot mix different JPA inheritance strategies. The strategy chosen at the top of the hierarchy applies to all levels below it. For instance, if you select the Joined Table inheritance strategy for a base class like `Pet`, that strategy will automatically extend to all subclasses, including multiple levels of subclasses such as `Bird` and `Parrot`.

The only exception to this rule is the use of `@MappedSuperclass`, which is not a true inheritance strategy but a way to define reusable fields and behaviors. If you observed closely, the `Pet` entity in our example above extends the `NamedEntity` class, which is annotated with `@MappedSuperclass`. This allows the `Pet` class to inherit common attributes like `id` and `name` without defining them again, while still defining an inheritance strategy (`@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)`) for its own hierarchy starting from `Pet`.

== Summary

This guide explored how JPA inheritance strategies can model complex domains while bridging the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases. We reviewed `@MappedSuperclass` for sharing common fields, Single Table Inheritance for simplicity and polymorphic queries, and Joined Table Inheritance for a more normalised schema as well as enforcing database-level constraints. Each approach was demonstrated with examples from the Petclinic application to showcase its strengths and trade-offs.

Inheritance strategies are powerful tools for reducing redundancy and aligning the domain model with business requirements. However, their effectiveness depends on selecting the right approach for the specific use case. Single Table Inheritance offers efficiency but limits constraints, while Joined Table Inheritance ensures data integrity with more complex queries. We also touched on Table-Per-Class Inheritance, noting its rare practicality due to significant limitations in performance and compatibility with frameworks like EclipseLink.

By understanding the trade-offs of each inheritance strategy, you can design maintainable, efficient domain models that align with their application’s needs. These techniques enable clear, flexible, and robust representations of hierarchical data, ensuring long-term scalability and maintainability for business applications.
