= Data Modeling: Entity Inheritance

Entity inheritance is a key approach for structuring domain models with shared attributes and specialized behavior. In the Pet Clinic application, for example, pets share common fields like name and birthdate, but specific types such as cats or birds have unique properties. Similarly, visits to the clinic can vary in type, requiring distinct data fields.

This guide explores JPA inheritance strategies and demonstrates their application in a Jmix project. Practical examples from the Pet Clinic domain model will illustrate how to choose the right strategy for different scenarios.

== What We are Going to Build

This guide enhances the https://github.com/Jmix-framework/Jmix-petclinic-2[Jmix Petclinic^] example by implementing various JPA inheritance strategies:

* **Mapped Superclass (NamedEntity):** We will look into the base class `NamedEntity` that centralizes common fields like `id`, `name`, and auditing attributes. Entities such as `Owner`, `PetType`, and `Specialty` inherit these fields.

* **Joined Table Inheritance (Pet Hierarchy):** The `Pet` base class includes subclasses like `Cat` and `Bird`. Subclass-specific attributes are stored in their own tables, while polymorphic queries allow listing all pets.

* **Single Table Inheritance (Visit Hierarchy):** The `Visit` base class encompasses subclasses like `RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUp`. All visits are stored in a single table, enabling efficient polymorphic queries and simplifying associations.

* **Table per Class Inheritance (Treatment Hierarchy):** The `Treatment` base class includes subclasses such as `Surgery`, `Medication`, and `Therapy`. Each subclass maps to its own table, with references to `Treatment` used for associations without polymorphic queries.

These scenarios highlight the strengths and trade-offs of each inheritance strategy within the Pet Clinic domain.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Business applications often deal with complex domains that require clear and maintainable representations of shared and specialized data. Entity inheritance allows us to model things that are very similar, but a different. It provides a way to define common attributes and behavior in a base class while letting subclasses add their own specifics. This not only avoids redundancy but also aligns closely with how developers think about their domain.

In the Pet Clinic application, we could use entity inheritance to structure the domain model based on real use-cases like:

* **Pets:** All pets share attributes such as `name` and `birthDate`, but specific types, such as cats and birds, introduce unique fields like `litterBoxTrained` or `canTalk`. Inheritance allows these specialized attributes to coexist with common ones, enabling operations like listing all pets or filtering by type.
* **Visits:** Different types of visits, such as `RegularCheckup` or `EmergencyVisit`, require additional fields specific to their type. At the same time, all visits share common properties like `visitDate` and `reason`, which can be easily handled in the base class.

[[impedance-mismatch]]
=== Impedance Mismatch

Object-oriented programming languages like Java naturally support inheritance, allowing developers to create hierarchies with shared attributes and specialized behavior. Polymorphism and method overriding make these hierarchies intuitive to design and maintain. In contrast, relational databases are built around flat, tabular structures, where data is stored in rows and columns without inherent support for hierarchical relationships. This fundamental difference is known as the "impedance mismatch" between object models and relational databases.

To resolve this mismatch, mapping frameworks like JPA use a combination of techniques to bridge the gap. One common approach is to utilize multiple tables to represent an inheritance hierarchy. For example, a base entity might be stored in a separate table, while subclasses have their own tables containing specific attributes. When retrieving data, an SQL `SELECT` statement is used to join these tables, combining the base and subclass data into a single result set that can be mapped back to the object model. Additionally, metadata such as a discriminator column is often stored in the database. This metadata indicates the specific type of each entity, ensuring that data is accurately converted back into the correct Java object when loaded.

Frameworks like JPA provide several strategies to handle these mappings. These strategies allow developers to balance trade-offs between query performance, data integrity, and schema complexity. The chosen strategy must align with the application’s specific requirements, as a poor choice can lead to inefficiencies or overly complex database structures.

[NOTE]
====
**Polymorphic Queries**
What are polymorphic queries? It is a JPQL feature, that allows you to query a base class and transparently retrieve instances of all its subclasses. For example, a query on the `Visit` base class like `SELECT e from petclinic_Visit e` can fetch both `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit` entities without needing separate queries for each subclass.

This feature simplifies working with inheritance hierarchies but is only supported by certain JPA strategies that define a shared structure for the base class. Depending on the chosen inheritance strategy, the underlying SQL query generated by JPQL differs, as the data may be spread across one or more tables in the database.
====

In this guide, we will explore how these strategies can be applied within the Petclinic domain to address real-world modeling challenges. Starting with Single Table Inheritance, we will work through examples that illustrate the strengths and appropriate use cases for each strategy.

[[mapped-superclass]]
== Mapped Superclass

The `@MappedSuperclass` inheritance strategy provides a mechanism to define shared attributes and behavior in a base class without creating a corresponding database table for the superclass. This approach is ideal for scenarios where entities share common fields, but there is no need for polymorphic querying or explicit relationships between those entities in the database.


[[mapped-superclass-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

In the Pet Clinic application, the `NamedEntity` class illustrates this concept. It defines common system attributes such as `id`, `version`, auditing fields (`createdBy`, `createdDate`, etc.), and a `name` field, which is annotated with `@InstanceName`. This enables the `name` field to serve as the default display name for the entity in the Jmix UI. Subclasses of `NamedEntity` inherit these attributes, allowing for cleaner, more maintainable code.

.NamedEntity.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/NamedEntity.java[tags=start-class;end-class]
----

The `NamedEntity` superclass is inherited by several entities, including `Pet`, `PetType`, and `Specialty`.

.PetType.java
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/pet/PetType.java[]
----

Each subclass has its own dedicated database table, and the shared fields from `NamedEntity` are incorporated into these tables. However, `NamedEntity` itself does not correspond to a table in the database.

image::mapped-superclass.svg[]

[[mapped-superclass-dataaccess]]
=== Data Access

Because `NamedEntity` does not have a corresponding table in the database, it cannot be queried directly or by using a polymorphic query. For instance, the following query is **not valid**:

.Invalid query (not supported for `@MappedSuperclass`)
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
SELECT n
FROM petclinic_NamedEntity n
WHERE n.name = :name
----

Instead, queries have to be performed on the specific subclasses. For example:

.Query by the `name` field in `Specialty`
[source,jpaql,indent=0]
----
SELECT s
FROM petclinic_Specialty s
WHERE s.name = :name
----

These queries operate on the subclass tables but utilize the shared fields defined in `NamedEntity`. Since the attributes are inherited, they are treated as if they are native to the subclasses in both JPQL queries and in the resulting SQL.

[[single-table-inheritance]]
== Single Table Inheritance

Single Table Inheritance is a strategy where all entities in an inheritance hierarchy are stored in a single database table. When a subclass has a new attribute, it is added as an additional column in the table. This way, the table holds a superset of the attributes of all subclasses as well as the attributes of the superclass itself.

The discriminator column (`DTYPE`) enables JPA to correctly map database rows back to their corresponding Java objects. When JPA reads a row from the `VISIT` table, it inspects the value in the `DTYPE` column to determine the appropriate subclass. Based on this value, JPA instantiates the correct Java object (e.g., `RegularCheckup` or `EmergencyVisit`) and populates its attributes with the corresponding column values from the row.

This approach offers simplicity in querying and efficient read operations, as all data resides in one table. However, it comes with the trade-off of potentially large tables with many nullable columns for subclass-specific fields.

[WARNING]
====
**No `NOT NULL` Constraints for Subclass Fields**

One important limitation of Single Table Inheritance is that it does not allow defining `NOT NULL` constraints for fields specific to subclasses. Since all entities in the hierarchy share the same table, subclass-specific fields must remain nullable to accommodate rows representing other entity types.

This limitation means that enforcing data integrity on subclass-specific fields at the database level is not possible. However, you can still ensure data integrity at the application level using Bean Validation in Jmix. You can use `@NotNull` on fields in the domain model to validate data before it is persisted to the database.
====

In the Pet Clinic application, Single Table Inheritance is ideal for modeling visits, which can have different types like `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit`. Common attributes are stored in the base class, while subclass-specific attributes are nullable fields in the same table.

[[single-table-inheritance-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

Let's look at the JPA entity definition in more detail. The base class contains attributes shared by all entities, while subclass-specific attributes are added as nullable columns. Below is the `Visit` base class and its two subclasses, `RegularCheckup` and `EmergencyVisit`.

.Visit.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/Visit.java[tags=imports;start-class;end-class]
----

.RegularCheckup.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/RegularCheckup.java[]
----

.EmergencyVisit.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/visit/EmergencyVisit.java[]
----

The database representation reflects this structure in a single table. Shared attributes from the base class, such as `visit_start`, `visit_end`, and `description`, are stored as common columns. Subclass-specific attributes, such as `next_appointment_date` for `RegularCheckup` and `emergency_type` or `life_threatening` for `EmergencyVisit`, are stored as nullable columns.

The `dtype` column acts as the discriminator, identifying the specific type of visit. For example, it would contain values that are indicated in the JPA entity definitions (`@DiscriminatorValue`): `REGULAR_CHECKUP` or `EMERGENCY_VISIT`. This allows JPA to correctly map each row to its respective Java subclass and populate the corresponding attribute

image::single-table-inheritance.svg[]

[[single-table-inheritance-ui]]
=== UI Representation

Now, let’s look into how Single Table Inheritance works in the user interface. With Jmix, we can create standard views to handle entities and their subclasses. In this section, we will explore how different visit types (`RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUpVisit`) can be managed, from creating new visits to displaying them in polymorphic lists.

==== Determining the Visit Type Detail View

To create a new visit, the user first selects the type of visit using a type selection dialog. This dialog presents the available subtypes, such as `RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, and `FollowUpVisit`.

Once the user selects a type, the application opens the corresponding detail view for that specific subtype, ensuring that the relevant fields are displayed for editing. This workflow makes it easy to handle the polymorphic nature of visits while keeping the user interface straightforward.

image::input-dialog-new-visit.png[Type Selection Dialog for Visits]

Here is how this is implemented in the controller when creating a new visit:

.VisitListView.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/VisitListView.java[tags=start-class;type-selection;end-class]
----
<1> The `visitTypes` map is created and passed set as the items for the select component.
<2> After the user confirms their selection, the selected visit type class is retrieved from the dialog's result via `closeEvent.getValue("type")`.
<3> The `viewNavigators.detailView` method navigates to the detail view for the selected visit type, creating a new instance of the entity and showing its specific fields.

Using the type selection dialog, the application dynamically determines the appropriate subclass for the new `Visit` entity. After the user confirms their selection, Jmix navigates to the corresponding detail view for the chosen subclass. This is because we pass in the correct type into the `detailView` method form above. These detail views are standard Jmix screens, customized to display the fields relevant to each specific visit type.

image::regular-checkup-detail.png[alt="Regular Checkup Detail View with Relevant Fields", title="Regular Checkup Detail View", link="_images/regular-checkup-detail.png"]

image::emergency-visit-detail.png[alt="Emergency Visit Detail View with Emergency-Specific Fields", title="Emergency Visit Detail View", link="_images/emergency-visit-detail.png"]

==== Polymorphic Query in Visit List View

The `VisitListView` demonstrates how Single Table Inheritance simplifies data loading and display by leveraging polymorphic queries. The table of visits (`Visit`) stores all types of visits (`RegularCheckup`, `EmergencyVisit`, `FollowUpVisit`) in a single table. The JPA entity hierarchy allows a unified approach to fetch and manage these entities, while the `CollectionDataLoader` and `CollectionContainer` automatically handle the polymorphic behavior.

Below is an excerpt of the XML configuration for the `VisitListView`:

.visit-list-view.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$src/main/resources/io/jmix/petclinic/view/visit/visit-list-view.xml[tags=visit-list-loader]
----
<1> The `collection` element defines a `CollectionContainer` for the base class `Visit`. This container serves as the binding point for the data grid in the UI and holds all visit entities, regardless of their specific subclass.
<2> The `loader` element specifies a `CollectionDataLoader` that uses the JPQL query `SELECT e FROM petclinic_Visit e`. This query fetches all rows from the `Visit` table, leveraging the discriminator column (`dtype`) to ensure JPA loads the correct subclass for each entity.


image::visit-list-view.png[alt="Visit List View", title="Visit List View", link="_images/visit-list-view.png"]

This approach ensures all visits, regardless of type, are displayed in a unified list in the application.

When we enable SQL logging, we can observe the SQL query executed by JPA. EclipseLink's logging output is functional but less readable, so the query has been formatted for clarity. Below is the formatted SQL query that corresponds to what is executed:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT LIMIT 0 50
    visit.ID,
    visit.DTYPE,
    visit.CREATED_BY,
    visit.CREATED_DATE,
    visit.DELETED_BY,
    visit.DELETED_DATE,
    visit.DESCRIPTION,
    visit.LAST_MODIFIED_BY,
    visit.LAST_MODIFIED_DATE,
    visit.TREATMENT_STATUS,
    visit.TYPE_,
    visit.VERSION,
    visit.VISIT_END,
    visit.VISIT_START,
    visit.ASSIGNED_NURSE_ID,
    visit.PET_ID
FROM
    PETCLINIC_VISIT visit
WHERE
    visit.DELETED_DATE IS NULL
ORDER BY
    visit.VISIT_START DESC,
    visit.ID ASC
----

As we have seen, Single Table Inheritance provides a straightforward way to manage entity hierarchies in a single table. It allows polymorphic queries and avoids the need for multiple joins, simplifying data access. However, there are limitations to this approach, particularly when subclass-specific fields have required fields, as we discussed earlier.

To overcome this limitation, we can use the Table Per Class inheritance strategy, which we will cover in the next section.

[[table-per-class]]
== Table Per Class Inheritance

Table Per Class Inheritance maps each subclass in the entity hierarchy to its own table. The base class does not have its own table, but its fields are duplicated in the tables of all subclasses. This enables subclass-specific constraints, such as `NOT NULL`, to be enforced directly at the database level.

In the Pet Clinic application, we will create a `Payment` entity hierarchy to demonstrate this strategy. Payments can be made in various ways (cash, via credit card or coming from an insurer). Those different payments have additional data that is unique to them but is still required to capture.

This hierarchy models real-world payment scenarios while allowing each payment type to maintain its own distinct attributes. At the same time, the Table Per Class strategy supports polymorphic queries, allowing the application to treat all payment types uniformly in the object model.

In the next section, we’ll take a closer look at the data model used to implement Table Per Class Inheritance.

[[table-per-class-datamodel]]
=== Data Model

In the Table Per Class Inheritance strategy, each subclass is mapped to its own database table. The fields of the base class are duplicated in each subclass's table, allowing each subclass to enforce specific constraints, such as `NOT NULL`, on its own fields. This makes the strategy particularly useful for use cases where subclass-specific data integrity is crucial.

Below is the entity hierarchy for the `Payment` base class and its subclasses, which demonstrate this strategy.

.Payment.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/payment/Payment.java[tags=start-class;end-class]
----
The `Payment` class defines common fields shared across all payment types:
- `amount`: The payment amount.
- `paymentDate`: The date the payment was made.
- `invoice`: A reference to the associated invoice.

.CashPayment.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/payment/CashPayment.java[]
----
The `CashPayment` class extends `Payment` to model cash transactions:
- `amountTendered`: The total amount of cash provided by the customer.
- `changeGiven`: The change returned to the customer after the transaction.

.CreditCardPayment.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/payment/CreditCardPayment.java[]
----
The `CreditCardPayment` class models payments made via credit card:
- `cardNumber`: The credit card number used for the transaction.
- `cardHolderName`: The name of the credit card holder.

.InsurancePayment.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$src/main/java/io/jmix/petclinic/entity/payment/InsurancePayment.java[]
----
The `InsurancePayment` class represents payments made through insurance:
- `insuranceProvider`: A reference to the insurance company responsible for the payment.
- `policyNumber`: The policy number under which the payment is made.

The data model ensures that subclass-specific constraints, like `NOT NULL` on `policyNumber` for `InsurancePayment`, are enforced at the database level.

As shown in the model, there is no discriminator column in the `Payment` entity. This is because each subclass is mapped to its own table, rather than sharing a single table with a column to distinguish between types.

Additionally, each subclass is annotated with its own `@Table` annotation, specifying the database table where its data will be stored. This ensures that fields specific to each subclass are enforced and stored separately in their respective tables.

image::table-per-class.svg[alt="Table Per Class Data Model", title="Table Per Class Data Model", link="_images/table-per-class.svg"]

The diagram above shows how the entity hierarchy is reflected in the database schema. Each subclass has its own table, and there is no table for the base class `Payment`.

In this setup, all fields defined in the `Payment` base class, such as `amount`, `payment_date`, and audit fields like `created_by` and `created_date`, are included in each subclass table. This means that these shared attributes are replicated across all subclass tables. Similarly, relationships defined in the base class, such as the `Invoice` association, are also present in all subclass tables as the `invoice_id` column.

Each subclass table further contains fields specific to its type of payment. For example, `InsurancePayment` includes additional fields like `policy_number` and an association to `InsuranceProvider`, represented by the `insurance_provider_id` column. This setup allows `InsurancePayment` to define relationships or attributes that are unique to its use case while still inheriting shared attributes and relationships from the base class.

This structure demonstrates the flexibility of the Table-Per-Class strategy: while all common attributes are inherited and stored in each subclass table, the schema also accommodates type-specific fields and relationships in a way that aligns directly with the subclass’s domain requirements.
